to run the project
after you exstract the files
use command line,

$ cd readfile-app
$ npm run dev

this will run the node express server wwith the API app
and ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --disable-host-check 
which build and serve the files.
disable-host-check flag is set to avoid issues with header permissions while accessing the API App.

OR

you can run the files in the dist folder after you run
node ./filebrowser-service/index.js
THE API service


TESTING
The testing was generated by the CLI. However, I had to add the configuration of each test inorder to pass green.

I also added some test of my own. (HIGHLIGHTED in green).

Due to time constraint I decided to stop there and submit the project first.
There was also an issue with permission to use the API
I had to use proxy.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
