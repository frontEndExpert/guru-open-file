to run the project
after you exstract the files
use command line, got to file broweser service
$ cd filebrowser-service
$ node index.js

then goto readfile folde
$ cd readfile-app
$ npm start

this will run ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --disable-host-check 
in order to avoid issues with header permissions while accessing the API App.

TESTING
The testing was generated by the CLI. However, I had to add the configuration of each test inorder to pass green.

I also added some test of my own. (HIGHLIGHTED in green).

Due to time constraint I decided to stop there and submit the project first.
There was also an issue with permission to use the API
I had to use proxy.
